          <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.125rem;"> Family Income and Schooling Relationship in the US and its Evolution</span>
          <br> Investment in human capital is an important source of productivity growth. However, credit constraints can distort skill investment decisions and result in less than socially optimal educational attainment. If borrowing constraints prevent economically disadvantaged youth from attending post-secondary institutions, the outcomes will be inefficient. However, if the reason for low-income youth not attending university would be that they’re not well-qualified or they don’t have taste for school, then the existing education gaps by income are not necessarily inefficient. That’s the reason for studying the underlying causes for family income – schooling attainment gaps. Previous research has generally shown that the effect of relative family income (interquartile) on educational attainment has increased over the years. This paper uses the model from Belzil and Hansen (2020) but contrarty to their paper, studies effect of relative family income as opposed to real family income as well as cognitive ability on the educational attainment of two cohorts of youth (NELS:88 and HSLS:09).​ The results show that, similar to Belley and Lochner (2007), the effect of relative family income on educational attainment of youth has increased from 1990's to 2010's.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.125rem;">Effect of Participation in After-School Activities and Working While in School on High School Performance in the US </span>
          <br>In this paper, I examined the effect of participation in different after-school activities on academic outcomes. Unlike most of the previous research and following Hansen (2008), instead of focusing on the effects of working while in school, I also looked at extracurricular activities and their effects on students’ GPAs for two surveys done 20 years apart which made it possible to look at the evolution of these effects through different generations. Since most likely these activities (both working and extracurricular activities) are endogenously chosen, I considered alternative approaches to address this issue. Descriptive statistics show that more than 70 percent of students participate in a form of extracurricular activity and in different years between 46 to 70 percent of students work while in school. The results from OLS estimation confirm that participation in after-school activities (including work), is endogenous. In this paper, two different approaches to deal with the endogeneity problem were proposed and implemented (proxy variables and fixed effect regressions). Participation in extracurricular activities is shown to be beneficial (for both cohorts) when using OLS estimations and adding math test scores as a proxy for unobserved ability that might impact the students’ decisions regarding participation in after school activities. However, these positive effects become statistically insignificant in the fixed effect regressions for both cohorts which shows that there might be other unobserved characteristics in effect that can not be counted for with math test scores. Moreover, the two estimation methods suggest that working while in high school could be detrimental for students’ GPAs. The negative effect is significant at older ages, specially in 1992 and 2012, and when running regressions on the intensity of working, the negative effect increases as the hours of work increase. Participation in extracurricular activities shows significant positive effect both when running OLS regressions and fixed effects. Comparing the results of fixed effects regressions for the two cohorts suggest that in the span of 20 years, the negative effect of working in high school has increased. This may be the result of difference in the types of jobs students hold during high school in each cohort.<br>

            <span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">Estimating the Technology of Youth Cognitive and Noncognitive Skill Formation</span>
          </span>
          <br> It is widely accepted that cognitive skills in children and youth have an important role in explaining their social and economic success later in life. There exists also a large body of interdisciplinary literature that study the important role of noncognitive skills on later life outcomes such as wage and education. There is a substantial body of empirical studies on the determinants of cognitive and noncognitive skills and their evolution. This paper estimates and identifies a model of the technology of skill formation. Building on the work done by Cunha and Heckman (2008), I estimate jointly the evolution of cognitive and noncognitive skills for high school students in the US. The paper models the self productivity of skills as well as their impact on each other’s productivity. The results show that cognitive and noncognitive skills do promote formation of each other. The analysis of noncognitive skills, their role in forming cognitive skills and the study of the role of cognitive skills in forming noncognitive skills and understanding the effectiveness of parental investment in shaping both types of skills in youth, can help decide upon the type of interventions needed for improving these skills and shed light on the family influence in this process. I estimate a dynamic factor model that uses covariance restrictions in linear systems to obtain identification using a version of dynamic state space models. The idea is to model cognitive and noncognitive skills, as well as parental investments as low dimensional latent variables. I use a variety of measurements related to skills and investments to proxy latent skills and investments. With enough measurements compared to the number of latent skills and investments, I can identify the latent factors that generate the production of skills through cross equation restrictions. Whenever in the process I need instruments, they are internally justified by the model of Cunha and Heckman(2007). I solve the problem of multiplicity of measurements by using all of them as proxies for low dimensional latent skills and investments.Applying the methodology to the two surveys (NELS88 and HSLS09), I find that: (1) Both cognitive and noncognitive skills change over the life cycle of the child up to adulthood. (2) Parental inputs do affect the formation of these skills in young adults (between 14 to 18 years old) and (3) the effect of different factors (such as parental education and parental investment) on the production of cognitive skills have increased between early 1990’s and early 2010’s
